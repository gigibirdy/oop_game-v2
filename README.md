# OOP_Game

This project was developed for a phrase hunt game. In each round of the game, player clicks start button to enter the game, a random phrase will be generated, player has 2 minutes to guess all letters contained in this phrase by clicking keys on an onscreen keyboard or pressing keys of their physical keyboard. Player loses the game if misses 5 guesses.

List of additional features:
1. background music (starts once player click the start button and ends when start overlay is visible).
2. countdown (starts once player enter the game and ends after 2 minutes or when start overlay is visible meaning player has won or lost the game).
3. blink animation to the border of phrase letters if match player's selection.
4. background images for the "lose" and "win" CSS class.
5. on/off button to stop and play the music.
